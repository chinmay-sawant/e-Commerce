# e-Commerce: A Spring Boot Learning Project

## Project Description

This project, "e-Commerce", is a hands-on learning initiative aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of core Spring Boot concepts. It serves as a practical platform to explore and implement various aspects of building a modern web application using the Spring ecosystem.

## Features & Concepts Explored

This project focuses on implementing and understanding:

* Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot.
* Implementing robust security using Spring Security.
* Integrating with Auth0 for JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication.
* Data persistence using Spring Data JPA.
* Database management with PostgreSQL and Hibernate.
* Setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Spring Boot
* **Security:** Spring Security, Auth0 (for JWT)
* **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA, Hibernate
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Future Enhancements

The project is planned to be extended with the following integrations:

* **Messaging:** Integration with Kafka for asynchronous communication between services.
* *More planned features to be added...*

## Getting Started

*(Add instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. This might include prerequisites, cloning the repository, database setup, configuring environment variables for Auth0, building, and running the application.)*

```bash
# Example commands (replace with actual instructions)
git clone [https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/e-Commerce.git](https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/e-Commerce.git)
cd e-Commerce
